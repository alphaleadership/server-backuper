# Important announcement
Hello. Unfortunately, Server Backuper will not be actively developed for a while. It's because school starts tomorrow, and I just won't have time. Thanks for understanding.

## ➲ What does it do?

Server Backuper protects your server from nukers and crash-bots.

## ➲ Why Server Backuper? There are lots of other bots.

Server Backuper uses its unique reputation system, which alerts about raids and doesn't alert about good moderation actions (like punishing raiders).

## ➲ Is it safe?

Yes! I will never put you a virus or something like that. If you are so worried, view the code and decide yourself!

## ➲ How do I get support?

Open an issue or join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/xzpcXYz6yK)!

## ➲ I don't have resources to run it myself!

Invite [this](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=797792817983389726&permissions=19584&scope=bot) bot, which is run by me!
